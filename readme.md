# Stencil ES Module Resolution Build Error

An error with the `dist-custom-elements` build occurs due to adding `"type": "module",` in a Stencil project's `package.json` file. This is the error:

```
ERROR in ../dist/components/index.js 1:0-81
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@stencil/core/internal/client' in '/home/ben/dev/stencil-component-starter/dist/components'
Did you mean 'index.js'?
BREAKING CHANGE: The request '@stencil/core/internal/client' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is strict EcmaScript Module, e. g. a module with javascript mimetype, a '*.mjs' file, or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.
```

## Repro Steps
1. Clone the repo and checkout the `esm-build-error` branch:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:benelan/stencil-component-starter.git
  git checkout esm-build-error
  ```
2. Run the following on the CLI and you will see the error above:
  ```bash
  npm i && npm run build
  ```
2. Run the following and the build will be fixed:
  ```bash
  npm run clean && npm i && npm run build:patched
  ```
3. Remove `"type": "module",` from `package.json` and the error will not occur when running:
  ```bash
  npm run clean && npm i && npm run build
  ```

### Note

I'm not sure why `my-component` doesn't render in the repro-sample when running `npm start:sample`. The build error and the fix reproduces here so I didn't take the time to look the rendering issue.

# Stencil Component Starter

This is a starter project for building a standalone Web Component using Stencil.

Stencil is also great for building entire apps. For that, use the [stencil-app-starter](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-app-starter) instead.

# Stencil

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-component-starter.git my-component
cd my-component
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To build the component for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
npm test
```

Need help? Check out our docs [here](https://stenciljs.com/docs/my-first-component).


## Naming Components

When creating new component tags, we recommend _not_ using `stencil` in the component name (ex: `<stencil-datepicker>`). This is because the generated component has little to nothing to do with Stencil; it's just a web component!

Instead, use a prefix that fits your company or any name for a group of related components. For example, all of the Ionic generated web components use the prefix `ion`.


## Using this component

There are three strategies we recommend for using web components built with Stencil.

The first step for all three of these strategies is to [publish to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

### Script tag

- Put a script tag similar to this `<script type='module' src='https://unpkg.com/my-component@0.0.1/dist/my-component.esm.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### Node Modules
- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Put a script tag similar to this `<script type='module' src='node_modules/my-component/dist/my-component.esm.js'></script>` in the head of your index.html
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc

### In a stencil-starter app
- Run `npm install my-component --save`
- Add an import to the npm packages `import my-component;`
- Then you can use the element anywhere in your template, JSX, html etc
